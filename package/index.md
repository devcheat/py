**Python Packages**
===
- [**Python Packages**](#python-packages)

---
A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that defines a single Python application environment that consists of modules and subpackages and sub-subpackages, and so on.

Consider a file Pots.py available in Phone directory. This file has the following line of source code −
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

def Pots():
print ("I'm Pots Phone")  
```
Similar, we have other two files having different functions with the same name as above. They are −
```
Phone/Isdn.py file having function Isdn()

Phone/G3.py file having function G3()
```
Now, create one more file `__init__.py` in the Phone directory −
```
Phone/__init__.py
```
To make all of your functions available when you have imported Phone, you need to put explicit import statements in `__init__.py` as follows −
```
from Pots import Pots
from Isdn import Isdn
from G3 import G3
```
After you add these lines to `__init__.py`, you have all of these classes available when you import the Phone package.
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Now import your Phone Package.
import Phone

Phone.Pots()
Phone.Isdn()
Phone.G3()
```
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −
```
I'm Pots Phone
I'm 3G Phone
I'm ISDN Phone
```
In the above example, we have taken example of a single function in each file, but you can keep multiple functions in your files. You can also define different Python classes in those files and then you can create your packages out of those classes.
